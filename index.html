        <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
        <p>Graduate from San Francisco State University with a Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I currently work for Wingstop in an assistant manager role in my free time, where I learned valuable professional 
	 skills such as complaint resolution, customer satisfaction, and quality control. I was also an instructor for iD 
	 Tech gaining experience in handling difficult situations, planning and teaching students ages, 7 to 18, computer languages
	 during their summer program. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as focused by my 
	 professors and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven teamwork, 
	 problem-solving, and multitasking skills. During my time at SFSU, I took part in a unique Software Engineering course that 
	 involves UI, UX, frontend work, and backend work on a website. This course simulated real world scenarios such as working 
	 as a team with a hierarchy of management, priority bug fixing in real time as well as documenting each step to keep track of each
	 milestone and process of the project. I was the team lead for my group and enforced communication, code review, in addition to 
	 ensuring standarizing our coding appropriately. </p>
