        <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
        <p>Graduated from San Francisco State University with a Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I have had the privilege of working for Wingstop in an assistant manager role in my free time, where I learned valuable professional skills such as complaint resolution, customer satisfaction, and quality control. I was also an instructor for iD Tech for 3 months, gaining experience in handling difficult situations, planning and teaching students computer languages during their summer program. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as focused by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven teamwork, problem-solving, and multitasking skills. I have taken a Software Engineering course which I believe is highly valuable for any position that involves a lot of UI, UX, frontend work, and backend work on a website. We practiced documentation, keeping track of each milestone and process of the project. I was the team lead for my group and enforced communication, code review, as well as ensure consistent teamwork. </p>
